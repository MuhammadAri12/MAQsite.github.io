                In the religious world, the approach of the millennium has long evoked doomsday scenarios and apocalyptic prophecies. But the recent focus on the secular threat of a calamitous computer glitch--the Y2K Bug--has created a specific vehicle with which to link the cosmic and the down-to-earth.
                And though most of these alarmist scenarios are being dismissed as products of fringe religious groups--critics say they can undermine or embarrass the true faith--even some mainstream Christians are publicly musing on whether possible chaos from worldwide computer failure could somehow be the contemporary manifestation of turmoil described in the Bible's book of the apocalypse that heralds the arrival of the Antichrist. Revelation obviously doesn't mention computers, but some in the Christian world think the confusion the Y2K bug could produce might be the sort of entry point for a figure to seize control of the world before Jesus Christ returns.<br><br>
                Wheaton College theology professor Donald Lake says Christians aren't alarmed about the date itself but about the real potential for major instability. Many fear the inability of computers and other electronic devices to conceptualize the date once 1999 becomes 2000 could lead to anarchy brought on by computer malfunction around the globe.
                "Of course, there is a kind of natural human anxiety that people have about the future," Lake said, "and there are plenty of biblical passages that say that toward the end of human history, there are going to be perilous times and natural disasters."<br><br>
                "Is it possible that we are sliding into the end-time events that I have read about and heard about in my childhood and in my family and my reading of the Book of Revelation and other places in the Scripture?" Dr. James Dobson, one of the country's best-known Christian teachers, asked on a radio program on Y2K that his influential Focus on the Family ministry organization produced. Dobson's panel of experts, including perhaps the two leading Christian authors on the Bug, stopped short of saying yes, but they also did not push the question off the table.
                Larry Spargimino, co-author of the 1998 book, "Y2K = 666?" a title referring to the "mark of the beast" in Bible prophecy, says, "In world history, whenever there's a major crisis, that's when totalitarian forces tend to take control.
                "There are a lot of things that are going to go into end-time events, but with Y2K, it's being hastened," Spargimino said. "Y2K is a contributing, moving force that is pulling events in prophecy together quicker than we could have imagined."<br><br>
                And though local pastors and theologians have dismissed a swelling number of the alarmist Christian books, newsletters and Internet Web sites as representing the fringe of Christianity, some mainstream groups have at least taken notice.
                Larry Eskridge, associate director of the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals in Wheaton, said the Y2K problem has "opened the floodgates" on prophecy. Eskridge said that even most trusted Christian sources have picked up on the issue to urge at least a bit of planning, because the Bible suggests in books such as Proverbs that a wise man is a prudent one.
                And a handful of large churches--with or without official stances on the Millennium Bug--also have been the sites for flea market-like sales of paraphernalia designed to help people survive a crisis. Merchandise ranges from gold coins to wood-burning stoves.<br><br>
                But many pastors in the Chicago area said they are concerned by those who suggest too loudly that Y2K could lead to Armageddon and the second coming of Jesus Christ.
                Erwin Lutzer, pastor of Chicago's Moody Church, said such views can hurt the credibility of Christians when they don't come true and lead to unnecessary panic. Although some people suggest that fleeing to a well-stocked bunker in the Rockies might be a wise idea as 2000 looms, Lutzer said heading for the hills is not the biblical response.
                Inam Haq, director of the school of the Islamic Foundation in Villa Park, said prophecy in his religion deals with the disintegration of the family and moral corruption, and anyway, next month begins year 1421 in the Muslim calendar.<br><br>
                Rabbi Victor Mirelman of the West Suburban Temple Har Zion in River Forest said the messianic writings of Judaism also have no ties to anything related to Y2K, the year or the bug. "Nothing in Judaism would pertain to it," Mirelman said, "and according to our way of calculating time, the year is 5759."
                Some local church leaders contacted recently said they are offering information on the bug or recommending books on it to members, but the decision to store food and water or adjust savings is being left for individuals to make.<br><br>
                "We haven't been trying to tell people how to think," said Mark Burgund, a pastor at Naperville's Calvary Temple Church who has taught Sunday school classes on the millennium problem. "There are some extreme alarmists out there and some head-in-the-sand kinds of views. We've tried to be balanced and tell people that you don't have to run scared--you put your trust in the Lord."
