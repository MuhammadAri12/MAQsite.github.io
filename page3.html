                Port Washington -- If the Y2K computer bug does its worst in Ozaukee and Washington counties, it would be as if a bad ice storm hit the two counties, officials in both counties said Friday.<br>
                What Y2K won't be is Armageddon, the officials said.<br>
                "On Dec. 31, you should have on hand in your house a week's worth of your needs," said David W. Barrow, one of the consultants working with Ozaukee County on the so-called year 2000 bug, or Y2K. "You should do the same thing as if you heard a big snowstorm was coming."
                Most people will probably have some minor disruptions, said Ozaukee County Supervisor Gus "Sandy" Wirth, who leads the County Board's Information Services Committee. However, people will have heat, lights and other essentials, Wirth said.<br><br>
                The Information Services Committee met with Ozaukee County's department heads to discuss what has been done and what still needs to be done to prepare for 2000.
                One of the committee's key functions should be to assure residents that things are not going to be as bad as predicted, Ozaukee County Sheriff's Department Lt. Edward Hermann said.<br><br>
                The county plans to not take anyone's word for anything, Evans said. Every piece of equipment will be checked, he said.<br>
                "We have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst," Wirth said.<br>
                On the positive side, preparation for the Y2K bug is helping the county, Wirth said. Even if nothing happens, the county will have a comprehensive disaster response plan in place as a result of the planning, he said.
                It also will allow an opportunity for residents to help their neighbors if problems arise, Wirth added. He said that "was a great opportunity for people."<br><br>
                A forum on Y2K for Cedarburg residents will be held sometime in late April, Light and Water Utility Manager Dale Lythjohan said. The utility is getting enough questions on Y2K issues to warrant a public forum, Lythjohan said.
